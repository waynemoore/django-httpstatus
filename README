What is it?
Django has a nice build in exception, Http404, which you can throw
from anywhere in your view code and it'll return a 404 error to the
user agent.  Unfortunately, none of the other error codes have been
given the same treatment.

How do I use it?
1. Add the middleware to your settings.py:

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        ...
        'httperrors.middleware.HttpStatusErrorsMiddleware',
        ...
    )

2. Import the exceptions and use them:

    from httperrors import Http405

    def foo(request):
        if request.POST:
	        raise Http405(['GET'])  # this method only allows post methods
